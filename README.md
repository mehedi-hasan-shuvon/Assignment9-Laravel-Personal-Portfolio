## Welcome to my personal portfolio

This website is created using HTML,CSS,Javascript & Laravel. Also used bootstarp for front-end framework, emailJS for sending emails etc.

How to set up:

- First, clone the project from github.
- Secondly, install dependencies by ```composer install```
- create a .env file and copy paste everything from .env.example 
- run ```php artisan key:generate``` to generate an application key
- configure the .env file (thing to remember: for sending emailJS have to give  SERVICE_ID, TEMPLATE_ID, USER_ID of your own)
- lastly, run ```php artisan serve``` to run the project
